Unverse is a lightweight - absolutely tiny(about 5k) - collection of terse cross-browser JavaScript functions that perform common tasks. Even if used only for its lightbox feature it is probably the smallest JavaScript light box you will find.

Top level functions include:
  * **Lightbox** pop-up for images, html, web pages
  * **Dropdown menu** support
  * **Drag and drop** - make any element draggagble and get notified of where it's dropped
  * **AJAX** - one line asynchronous calls to server to populate parts of a web page
  * **DOM Ready** - start executing javascript without waiting for images and other heavy page elements to load

It also provides lots of cross-browser JavaScript short cuts to show and hide elements, get items from the DOM, get values from form fields, enquire on window dimensions and populate elements using AJAX.
